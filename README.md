# Project Overview

In the "Would You Rather?" Project, I've built a web app that lets a user play the “Would You Rather?” game. The game goes like this: A user is asked a question in the form: “Would you rather [option A] or [option B] ?”. Answering "neither" or "both" is against the rules.

In this app, users will be able to:
 - answer questions
 - see which questions they haven’t answered
 - see how other people have voted, post questions
 - see the ranking of users on the leaderboard

# What I learned from doing this project

This project  solidified my understanding of React and Redux while giving me a chance to express my creativity. I woked on improving the predictability of your application’s state; establish strict rules for getting, listening, and updating the store; and identify what state should live inside of Redux and what state should live inside of React components.
